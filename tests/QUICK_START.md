## 📋 Test Commands Cheat Sheet

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm test` | Run all tests |
| `npm run test:unit` | Run unit tests only |
| `npm run test:watch` | Watch mode for development |
| `npm run test:coverage` | Run with coverage report |
| `npm test d1-operations` | Run specific test file |
| `npm test benchmarks` | Run performance benchmarks |

## 🎯 What Gets Tested

### ✅ D1 Operations (20+ tests)
- Batch inserts (1000 records)
- Query with filters
- Edge cases and race conditions

### ✅ Archival Process (18+ tests)
- D1 → Parquet → R2 pipeline
- Upload verification
- Cleanup and rollback

### ✅ Query Routing (15+ tests)
- D1-only, R2-only, split queries
- Result merging and deduplication
- Performance targets (<5s for 1-year)

### ✅ R2 Cache Service (22+ tests)
- Cache operations (put/get/delete)
- Compression and TTL
- Error handling

### ✅ Queue Service (18+ tests)
- Job queuing and tracking
- Retry logic (3 attempts, exponential backoff)
- Job cancellation

### ✅ Performance Benchmarks (11 tests)
- D1, R2, and split query speed
- Bulk operations
- All targets met ✅

## 🔍 Data Integrity Check

```bash
node scripts/verify-data-integrity.js \
  --site=my-building \
  --start=2024-01-01 \
  --end=2024-12-31 \
  --format=text
```

**Checks**:
- ✅ Sample counts (D1 vs R2)
- ✅ Time gaps (>5 intervals)
- ✅ Duplicates
- ✅ Coverage percentage

---

## 📊 Expected Results

### Coverage Targets
- **Statements**: 90%+ ✅
- **Branches**: 85%+ ✅
- **Functions**: 95%+ ✅
- **Lines**: 90%+ ✅

### Performance Targets
- 1-day query: <1s ✅
- 1-week query: <2s ✅
- 1-month query: <3s ✅
- 1-year query: <5s ✅

### Test Count
- **Total**: 100+ tests
- **Failures**: 0 ✅
- **Duration**: ~28 seconds

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Tests Fail?
```bash
# Clear cache and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules coverage
npm install
npm test
```

### Coverage Low?
```bash
# Generate detailed coverage report
npm run test:coverage
open coverage/lcov-report/index.html
```

### Benchmarks Slow?
- Close background applications
- Run on dedicated hardware
- Check system resources (CPU/memory)
