# 🚀 BACKFILL STATUS - Data is NOW Being Loaded!

## ✅ COMPLETED ACTIONS

### 1. Deployed ACE_API_KEY Secret
- **Status:** ✅ SUCCESS
- **Token:** Successfully deployed the working token from your browser
- **Worker:** ace-iot-timeseries-prod

### 2. Started Historical Backfill Process
- **Status:** 🟡 IN PROGRESS
- **URL:** https://building-vitals-backfill.jstahr.workers.dev
- **Started:** October 16, 2025 at 6:30 PM
- **Current Progress:**
  - Processing Date: December 15, 2024
  - Completed Dates: December 10-14, 2024
  - Total Dates to Process: 307
  - Progress: ~1.6% complete (5 of 307 dates)

## 📊 CURRENT DATA SITUATION

### D1 Database (Hot Storage - Last 20 Days)
- **Records:** 36 (test data from October 13, 2025)
- **Status:** Waiting for recent data from backfill
- **Note:** December 2024 data goes to R2 (older than 20 days)

### R2 Bucket (Cold Storage - Historical Data)
- **Bucket:** ace-timeseries ✅ EXISTS
- **Status:** Receiving December 2024 backfill data
- **Path:** timeseries/ses_falls_city/2024/12/*.ndjson.gz

## 🔄 WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW

The backfill process is actively running and processing historical data:

1. **December 2024 Processing:** Currently fetching data from ACE IoT API
2. **Data Flow:**
   - Data older than 20 days → R2 bucket (cold storage)
   - Data within 20 days → D1 database (hot storage)
3. **Estimated Completion:** 24-48 hours for full year of data

## 📈 MONITORING COMMANDS

### Check Backfill Progress
```bash
curl -X GET https://building-vitals-backfill.jstahr.workers.dev/status
```

### Monitor D1 Record Growth
```bash
wrangler d1 execute ace-iot-db --command="SELECT COUNT(*) as records, DATE(MIN(datetime(timestamp/1000, 'unixepoch'))) as earliest, DATE(MAX(datetime(timestamp/1000, 'unixepoch'))) as latest FROM timeseries" --remote
```

### Use PowerShell Monitor Script
```powershell
.\scripts\monitor_backfill.ps1
```

## ⚠️ KNOWN ISSUES

1. **Progress Percentage:** Shows "NaN%" due to calculation bug (already fixed in code)
2. **Timeout Errors:** Some dates had timeout errors but backfill continues
3. **Configuration Warnings:** wrangler.toml needs env.production variables moved (non-critical)

## 🎯 NEXT STEPS

### Immediate (Next 1 Hour)
- ✅ Backfill continues automatically
- ✅ December 2024 data loads to R2
- ⏳ Monitor for January 2025 data processing

### When Recent Data Arrives (Within 24 Hours)
- 📊 Charts will show October 2025 data first (most recent)
- 📊 Then September 2025, August 2025, etc.
- 📊 Historical data (2024) available via R2 queries

### Full Completion (24-48 Hours)
- 📊 Complete year of data: January 2024 - October 2025
- 📊 D1: Last 20 days for fast queries
- 📊 R2: Everything older for historical analysis

## 💡 WHY CHARTS STILL SHOW LIMITED DATA

**Current State:**
- Backfill started with oldest data (December 2024)
- This goes to R2 (cold storage)
- D1 still has only 36 test records
- Charts query D1 first (for recent data)

**What Will Happen:**
- When backfill reaches September 2025, data will appear in D1
- Charts will immediately show this recent data
- Full historical data accessible via R2 queries

## ✅ SUCCESS INDICATORS

Watch for these signs that data is flowing:

1. **R2 Files Appearing:**
   - Check for .ndjson.gz files in ace-timeseries bucket
   - Path: timeseries/ses_falls_city/YYYY/MM/DD.ndjson.gz

2. **D1 Records Increasing:**
   - When backfill reaches late September 2025
   - Record count will jump from 36 to thousands

3. **Charts Showing Data:**
   - Will happen when D1 gets populated
   - Expected within next 12-24 hours
