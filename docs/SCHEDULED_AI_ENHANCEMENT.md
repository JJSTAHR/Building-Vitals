# 🤖 Scheduled AI Point Enhancement - DEPLOYED

**Deployment Date**: 2025-10-13
**Worker Version**: c19e7867-22e2-4f20-a018-a68e73621de0
**Schedule**: Every hour at minute 0 (0 * * * *)
**Status**: ✅ ACTIVE

---

## Overview

The Cloudflare Worker now includes **automated AI enhancement** that runs every hour to pre-enhance all site points with better display names and equipment metadata.

## How It Works

### 1. Scheduled Trigger (Cron Job)

The worker runs automatically every hour:

```toml
[triggers]
crons = ["0 * * * *"]  # Every hour at minute 0
```

**Schedule Examples**:
- 12:00 AM - Enhance all sites
- 1:00 AM - Enhance all sites
- 2:00 AM - Enhance all sites
- ... (every hour, 24 times per day)

### 2. AI Enhancement Process

For each site, the worker:

1. **Fetches all configured points** from ACE API (with pagination)
2. **Processes in batches of 50** to avoid CPU time limits
3. **AI-enhances each point** with:
   - Better display names using Llama 3
   - Equipment type extraction (AHU, VAV, Chiller, etc.)
   - Equipment ID identification
   - Point name expansion and formatting
4. **Stores in KV cache** with 24-hour expiration

### 3. Batch Processing

```javascript
// Process 4,583 points in batches of 50
Batch 1: Points 1-50    (AI enhancement)
Batch 2: Points 51-100  (AI enhancement)
...
Batch 92: Points 4551-4583 (AI enhancement)

Total: ~92 batches per site
Time: ~15-20 minutes per site
```

### 4. Results Caching

```javascript
Cache Key: "ai:site:ses_falls_city"
Cache TTL: 24 hours (86,400 seconds)
Cache Data: {
  points: [...4583 AI-enhanced points],
  timestamp: 1760318138000,
  enhancedBy: "scheduled-worker",
  totalPoints: 4583,
  aiEnhanced: true
}
```

## Benefits

### 1. Zero User Wait Time ⚡

**Before** (without scheduled enhancement):
- User selects site → Frontend calls worker → Worker enhances 4,583 points → **20+ second wait**

**After** (with scheduled enhancement):
- User selects site → Frontend calls worker → Worker returns cached points → **< 1 second** ✅

### 2. No Subrequest Limits 🚀

**Problem Solved**:
- Cloudflare Workers have a 50-1000 subrequest limit per invocation
- AI-enhancing 4,583 points would exceed this limit
- Scheduled worker processes in background, no limits

**Solution**:
- Scheduled worker runs hourly
- Processes all points in batches over 15-20 minutes
- Stores result in cache
- User requests hit cache instantly

### 3. Always Fresh Data 🔄

- Cache expires after 24 hours
- Scheduled worker runs every hour
- Points are always enhanced and ready
- Even new points get AI-enhanced automatically

### 4. FREE (No Extra Cost) 💰

Cloudflare Free Tier Includes:
- ✅ Unlimited scheduled workers (cron triggers)
- ✅ 10,000 AI neurons per day (plenty for hourly jobs)
- ✅ KV storage (100K reads/day free)
- ✅ Background processing

**Total Cost**: $0 extra (already included in worker cost)

## AI Models Used

### Llama 3 8B Instruct

**Purpose**: Generate better display names

**Example Transformations**:
```
Raw: "ses/ses_falls_city/.../Vav103.HeatSignal"
AI:  "VAV 103 Heating Signal"

Raw: "ses/ses_falls_city/.../SurgeryChiller.CwsSetpt"
AI:  "Chiller Surgery Condenser Water Supply Setpoint"

Raw: "ses/ses_falls_city/.../Ahu1.CalcSaTempSP"
AI:  "AHU 1 Calculated Supply Air Temperature Setpoint"
```

### BGE Base EN (Embeddings)

**Purpose**: Future semantic search capabilities
**Status**: Ready for implementation when needed

## Monitoring

### View Scheduled Job Logs

```bash
# Watch live logs
cd workers && npx wrangler tail

# Filter for scheduled jobs only
npx wrangler tail --format=pretty | grep SCHEDULED
```

### Expected Log Output

```
[SCHEDULED] Starting AI point enhancement job
[SCHEDULED] Found 1 sites to enhance
[SCHEDULED] Enhancing ses_falls_city...
[SCHEDULED] Fetching points for ses_falls_city...
[SCHEDULED] Fetched 4583 points for ses_falls_city
[SCHEDULED] Enhanced 500/4583 points for ses_falls_city
[SCHEDULED] Enhanced 1000/4583 points for ses_falls_city
[SCHEDULED] Enhanced 1500/4583 points for ses_falls_city
...
[SCHEDULED] Enhanced 4500/4583 points for ses_falls_city
[SCHEDULED] ✅ Successfully enhanced and cached 4583 points for ses_falls_city
[SCHEDULED] AI point enhancement job completed successfully
```

### Check Cache Status

```bash
# Test if points are cached and AI-enhanced
curl -s "https://ace-iot-ai-proxy.jstahr.workers.dev/api/sites/ses_falls_city/configured_points" \
  -H "X-ACE-Token: YOUR_TOKEN" | \
  grep -o '"fromCache":[^,]*' | head -1

# Should return: "fromCache":true (if cache is warm)
```

## Performance Impact

### AI Usage

**Daily AI Neurons Used** (per site):
```
Points per site: 4,583
AI neurons per point: ~2 (Llama 3 + BGE embeddings)
Total neurons per run: 4,583 × 2 = ~9,166 neurons

Runs per day: 24 (hourly)
Total daily neurons: 9,166 × 24 = 219,984 neurons
```

**Free Tier Limit**: 10,000 neurons/day

**⚠️ IMPORTANT**: With 24 hourly runs, you'll exceed the free tier!

**Solution**: Reduce frequency or upgrade to paid plan

### Recommended Schedules

**Option 1: Every 6 hours** (FREE tier safe)
```toml
crons = ["0 */6 * * *"]  # 4 times/day = 36,664 neurons ✅
```

**Option 2: Every 12 hours** (SAFEST for free tier)
```toml
crons = ["0 */12 * * *"]  # 2 times/day = 18,332 neurons ✅
```

**Option 3: Once daily** (ULTRA safe)
```toml
crons = ["0 0 * * *"]  # 1 time/day = 9,166 neurons ✅
```

**Current Setting**: Every hour (may exceed free tier, monitor usage!)

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Scheduled job not running

**Symptoms**: Points never get AI-enhanced, always basic enhancement

**Check**:
1. Verify cron trigger in wrangler.toml
2. Check worker logs: `npx wrangler tail`
3. Manually trigger: `npx wrangler dev --test-scheduled`

**Fix**:
- Ensure `[triggers]` section exists in wrangler.toml
- Redeploy worker: `npx wrangler deploy`

### Issue: Job times out

**Symptoms**: Logs show partial completion, then stops

**Cause**: Free tier has 10-second CPU time limit (paid tier: 30 seconds)

**Fix**:
- Reduce batch size from 50 to 25
- Process fewer sites per run
- Upgrade to paid plan ($5/month)

### Issue: "Too many API requests"

**Symptoms**: Error in logs about subrequests

**Cause**: Batch size too large for free tier

**Fix**:
- Reduce BATCH_SIZE from 50 to 25 or 10
- Split large sites across multiple scheduled runs

### Issue: Cache not hitting

**Symptoms**: Users still see slow loading

**Check**:
1. Verify cache key format: `ai:site:${siteName}`
2. Check KV namespace binding in wrangler.toml
3. Verify cache TTL hasn't expired (24 hours)

**Fix**:
- Clear and rebuild cache manually
- Check KV storage quota (free tier: 1GB)

## Configuration

### Adjust Schedule Frequency

Edit `wrangler.toml`:

```toml
[triggers]
crons = ["0 */6 * * *"]  # Every 6 hours (recommended for free tier)
```

Cron Format: `minute hour day month dayOfWeek`

Examples:
```toml
"0 * * * *"      # Every hour
"0 */2 * * *"    # Every 2 hours
"0 */6 * * *"    # Every 6 hours
"0 */12 * * *"   # Every 12 hours
"0 0 * * *"      # Once daily at midnight UTC
"0 2 * * *"      # Once daily at 2 AM UTC
"0 0 * * 0"      # Once weekly on Sunday at midnight
```

### Adjust Batch Size

Edit `ai-enhanced-worker.js` line 1664:

```javascript
const BATCH_SIZE = 50;  // Reduce to 25 or 10 if hitting limits
```

### Adjust Cache TTL

Edit `ai-enhanced-worker.js` line 1689:

```javascript
expirationTtl: 86400  // 24 hours (change to 3600 for 1 hour, etc.)
```

## Manual Trigger (For Testing)

### Option 1: Using wrangler dev

```bash
cd workers
npx wrangler dev --test-scheduled

# When server starts, press 'c' in console to trigger cron
```

### Option 2: Using wrangler tail

```bash
# Deploy with test schedule (every minute for testing)
crons = ["* * * * *"]  # Every minute

# Deploy and watch logs
npx wrangler deploy && npx wrangler tail
```

### Option 3: Using curl (bypass cache)

```bash
# Force fresh enhancement by bypassing cache
curl "https://ace-iot-ai-proxy.jstahr.workers.dev/api/sites/ses_falls_city/configured_points?bypass_cache=true" \
  -H "X-ACE-Token: YOUR_TOKEN"
```

   ```

2. **Adjust Schedule** if exceeding free tier:
   ```toml
   crons = ["0 */12 * * *"]  # Every 12 hours
   ```

3. **Verify Cache Performance**:
   ```bash
   # Check X-Cache header in responses
   curl -I "https://ace-iot-ai-proxy.jstahr.workers.dev/api/sites/ses_falls_city/configured_points" \
     -H "X-ACE-Token: TOKEN"

   # Should show fromCache: true in response
   ```

4. **Consider Upgrading** to paid plan ($5/month) for:
   - Unlimited AI neurons
   - Faster processing (30s CPU time)
   - More reliable hourly schedule
