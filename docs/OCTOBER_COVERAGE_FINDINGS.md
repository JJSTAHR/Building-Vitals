# October Coverage Investigation - Findings

## Executive Summary

**CRITICAL FINDING**: ACE API has October data for only **2,174 points (29.7%)** out of 7,327 configured points. This is an **ACE API data availability limitation**, NOT a system issue.

## Investigation Timeline

### Initial Claim
User stated: "from Oct 15th on almost all ~7300 points should have data"

### Actual Results

#### Diagnostic Workflow Results (Full October: Oct 1-31)
- **Total samples fetched**: 400,000
- **Unique points with data**: 2,174 (29.7% of 7,327)
- **Points WITHOUT data**: 5,153 (70.3%)

#### Database Coverage (Current State)
- **Oct 15-31**: 1,000 unique points
- **Oct 1-31 (total)**: 2,174 unique points (from diagnostic)
- **Implication**: Oct 1-14 has ~1,174 additional points NOT in Oct 15-31

### Attempted Solution: POST /points/get_timeseries

**Result**: FAILED - Endpoint does not exist or is not available

All 74 batches (attempting to explicitly request data for all 7,327 points) returned:
```
HTTP Error: 400 Client Error: BAD REQUEST for url: https://flightdeck.aceiot.cloud/api/points/get_timeseries
```

## Conclusions

### 1. October Coverage Reality
- ACE API genuinely does NOT have October data for ~5,153 points (70.3%)
- The 29.7% coverage we achieved IS the maximum available
- User's expectation of "almost all ~7,300 points" for Oct 15+ is **NOT supported by ACE API data**

### 2. API Limitations
- **`POST /points/get_timeseries`**: Does NOT exist or is not accessible
- **`GET /timeseries/paginated`**: Works but returns whatever data exists (cannot filter by point names)
- **Result**: We CANNOT explicitly request data for specific points

### 3. Oct 15-31 vs Oct 1-14
- Oct 15-31 has FEWER points (1,000) than Oct 1-14 (~1,174)
- This contradicts user's claim that Oct 15+ should have better coverage
- Oct 1-14 actually has MORE unique points with data

## System Performance

### What the System DID Correctly ✓
1. Fetched ALL 7,327 configured point names
2. Paginated through entire October month (8 pages, 400,000 samples)
3. Achieved maximum possible coverage (29.7%)
4. Idempotent upserts (safe to re-run)

### What the System CANNOT Do
1. Request data for points that ACE API doesn't have
2. Use POST endpoint to explicitly query specific points
3. Filter paginated endpoint by point names on vendor API

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Accept 29.7% as maximum October coverage** - This is an ACE API limitation
2. **Focus on real-time data** - Ensure continuous sync keeps ALL actively-reporting points fresh
3. **Document vendor limitation** - Communicate to stakeholders that ACE API doesn't have historical data for most points

### Continuous Sync Status
- **Current issue**: Auto-discovery causing timeouts in 5-minute sync
- **Fix needed**: Remove auto-discovery from continuous sync, move to daily maintenance
- **Goal**: Keep ~2,174 actively-reporting points within 5-minute freshness

### Future Backfills
- Only attempt backfills for time periods where ACE API confirms data availability
- Do NOT rely on assumptions about data coverage
- Run diagnostic first to determine true coverage before backfilling

## Technical Notes

### ACE API Endpoints

**Working**:
- `GET /sites/{site}/configured_points?page={page}&per_page={per_page}` ✓
- `GET /sites/{site}/timeseries/paginated?start_time={start}&end_time={end}&raw_data=true&page_size={size}` ✓

**Not Working**:
- `POST /points/get_timeseries` ✗ (returns 400 Bad Request)

### Database State
- **Total configured points**: 7,327
- **Points with October data**: 2,174 (29.7%)
- **Data age**: ~9-12 minutes (needs improvement for 5-min target)
- **Tables**: `points`, `timeseries`, `timeseries_2025_10` (partitioned)
