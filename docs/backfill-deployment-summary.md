2. ✅ Fixed wrangler config to include all bindings in production environment
3. ✅ Deployed worker successfully to Cloudflare Workers
4. ✅ Set ACE_API_KEY secret
5. ✅ Generated and set BACKFILL_API_KEY secret
6. ✅ Triggered initial backfill (2024-09-14 to 2024-10-14, 30 days)

## Known Issues

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Worker Completing with 0 Records

**Problem:** Backfill worker immediately completes with status="completed" but days_completed=0 and records_processed=0.

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- The `ctx.waitUntil()` async execution is completing without processing data
- Most likely cause: `fetchPointsList()` ACE API call is failing silently
- Error handling in background execution swallows the actual error
- Worker marks as "completed" even though no work was done

**Evidence:**
```json
{
  "status": "completed",
  "days_completed": 0,
  "days_total": 30,
  "records_processed": 0
}
```

**Possible Causes:**
1. ACE API authentication failing (ACE_API_KEY invalid or expired)
2. ACE API endpoint for configured_points returning empty array
3. Network timeout or connectivity issue to ACE API
4. Worker CPU limit exceeded (30s limit)
5. Error in async execution not being logged

---

## Debugging Steps to Take

### 1. Check Worker Logs
```bash
npx wrangler tail --config workers/wrangler-backfill.toml --env production --format pretty
```

### 2. Test ACE API Directly
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer ACE_60b9c8ce83bdf20bf7a83f3bc03ef8b0" \
  https://flightdeck.aceiot.cloud/api/sites/ses_falls_city/configured_points
```

### 3. Add More Logging
Modify `executeBackfill()` to log every step:
- Log when entering function
- Log after fetching points
- Log after each day processes
- Log all errors with stack traces

### 4. Test with Synchronous Execution
Remove `ctx.waitUntil()` and run backfill synchronously to see actual errors:
```javascript
// Temporary debug version
await executeBackfill(env, { ... });
return Response with actual error/success
```

### 5. Check KV State
```bash
# Check if error logs were written
npx wrangler kv:key list --namespace-id fa5e24f3f2ed4e3489a299e28f1bffaa --prefix "backfill:errors:"
```

---

## Workaround Options

### Option 1: Switch to Durable Objects
Use Durable Objects instead of `ctx.waitUntil()` for long-running backfill tasks. This provides better error visibility and state management.

### Option 2: Queue-Based Approach
Use Cloudflare Queues to process backfill asynchronously with retry logic and better observability.

### Option 3: Shorter Time Windows
Instead of 30 days, trigger multiple 1-day backfills sequentially to identify which day fails.

### Option 4: External Orchestration
Run backfill from an external Node.js script that calls the worker's API endpoints directly, bypassing `ctx.waitUntil()`.

---

## API Endpoints

### Start Backfill
```bash
curl -X POST https://building-vitals-backfill.jstahr.workers.dev/backfill/start \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer BACKFILL_06855205f320278d5e6e0535d3e5e80f03314b688e709c4c0f3c77cea0f8bb8a" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "start_date": "2024-09-14",
    "end_date": "2024-10-14",
    "force_restart": true
  }'
```

### Check Status
```bash
curl https://building-vitals-backfill.jstahr.workers.dev/backfill/status
```

### Cancel Backfill
```bash
curl -X POST https://building-vitals-backfill.jstahr.workers.dev/backfill/cancel \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer BACKFILL_06855205f320278d5e6e0535d3e5e80f03314b688e709c4c0f3c77cea0f8bb8a"
```

## Next Steps (Priority Order)

1. **IMMEDIATE:** Check worker logs for actual errors
2. **HIGH:** Test ACE API endpoints directly to verify authentication
3. **HIGH:** Add verbose logging to executeBackfill() function
4. **MEDIUM:** Switch to synchronous execution temporarily for debugging
5. **MEDIUM:** Implement Queue-based approach for production reliability
6. **LOW:** Add monitoring/alerting for backfill failures

## Conclusion

The Backfill Worker has been successfully **deployed** but is **not yet functional**. The worker completes immediately without processing data, indicating an error in the background execution that is not being properly logged or reported. The issue requires debugging of the ACE API integration and potentially refactoring the async execution pattern.

**Recommendation:** Before running a full 30-day backfill, resolve the 0-records issue by testing with a single day and adding comprehensive logging.
