- Box plots lack comparative hypothesis testing
- Line charts have no confidence intervals or uncertainty quantification
- Users cannot distinguish signal from noise

**Impact:**
- Risk of false conclusions based on spurious correlations
- No quantification of uncertainty in trends
- Decisions made on visual intuition rather than statistical evidence

**Evidence from Data Science Report:**
- Scatter plots: 7/10 (limited by "lacks statistical significance testing")
- Box plots: 8/10 (but "lacks comparative capabilities")
- Line charts: 7/10 ("no predictive capabilities")

**Recommended Fix:** See P1 Recommendation #3 (Enhance Statistical Rigor)

---

#### Issue 2: High Cognitive Load for Chart Selection
**Problem:**
- 23 charts with no guided selection process
- Users must know exact point requirements (e.g., scatter = exactly 2 points, VAV = exactly 7)
- No validation or smart suggestions during point selection
- Risk of selecting wrong chart for the analysis goal

**Impact:**
- Steep learning curve for new users
- High probability of configuration errors
- Underutilization of advanced charts (users stick to familiar line charts)

**Evidence from Research Report:**
- "User Selection Philosophy: user-driven point selection model with no automatic presets"
- "Point Requirements Matrix" shows strict requirements (scatter = 2, VAV = 7, parallel coords = 3+)
- Recommendation: "Add Chart Selection Wizard with questionnaire"

**Recommended Fix:** See P0 Recommendation #2 (Guided Chart Selection Wizard)

---

#### Issue 3: Zero Predictive Analytics Capabilities
**Problem:**

#### P2-3: Add Weather Normalization for Energy Analysis 🌤️

**Problem Solved:** Issue from Data Science Report (enable weather-corrected baselines)

**Description:**
Auto-fetch weather data and enable weather-normalized energy analysis.

**Implementation:**

**Weather API Integration:**
- Fetch historical weather (NOAA, Weather Underground)
- Cache locally for performance
- Auto-match timestamps with energy data

**Weather Normalization Methods:**
1. **Degree-Day Method**
   - Heating Degree Days (HDD): base 65°F
   - Cooling Degree Days (CDD): base 65°F
   - Normalize energy: `kWh_normalized = kWh / CDD`

2. **Regression-Based**
   - Model: `Energy = baseline + α*HDD + β*CDD`
   - Use regression coefficients for normalization
   - Display actual vs weather-normalized trend

**Visual Display:**
- Line chart with 2 series: Actual energy + Weather-normalized energy
- Divergence highlighting (when actual > normalized = inefficiency)
- Cost impact: "Weather cost $X, inefficiency cost $Y"

**Example Insight:**
```
Energy Analysis (Weather-Normalized)
────────────────────────────────────
Actual Energy:     125,000 kWh
Weather-Normalized: 105,000 kWh
Weather Impact:      20,000 kWh (16%)
Efficiency Gap:      5,000 kWh (4%) ← Addressable waste
```

**Success Metrics:**
- Energy analysis accuracy: +40%
- Isolation of building inefficiency: 100% of cases
- Savings identification: +$5,000/month average

**Effort Estimate:** 8 developer-days
- 3 days: Weather API integration
- 3 days: Normalization algorithms
- 2 days: UI (weather-normalized toggle)

**Dependencies:**
- Weather API (NOAA, OpenWeather, etc.)
- Building location data

**Risk:** Low (weather APIs are reliable)

---

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks

#### Risk 1: ML Model Accuracy (High Impact, Medium Probability)
**Risk:** Anomaly detection produces too many false positives, eroding user trust.

**Mitigation:**
- Extensive testing with real building data (2 pilot buildings)
- User-adjustable sensitivity thresholds
- "Learn from feedback" feature (mark false positives to improve model)
- Gradual rollout: Enable for specific chart types first

**Contingency:** If accuracy <90%, fall back to simpler statistical methods (Z-score)

---

#### Risk 2: Performance Degradation (Medium Impact, Low Probability)
**Risk:** ML algorithms slow down chart rendering, especially for large datasets.

**Mitigation:**
- Web Workers for background computation (non-blocking)
- Progressive enhancement (show chart first, add insights asynchronously)
- Caching of computed results (5-minute TTL)
- Sampling for very large datasets (>100K points)

**Contingency:** Allow users to disable ML features in settings

---

#### Risk 3: Weather API Reliability (Low Impact, Medium Probability)
**Risk:** Weather API downtime breaks weather normalization features.

**Mitigation:**
- Fallback to cached historical weather data
- Graceful degradation (show non-normalized chart if API unavailable)
- Multi-provider fallback (NOAA primary, OpenWeather backup)

**Contingency:** Display "Weather data unavailable" message, continue with basic analysis

---

### User Adoption Risks

#### Risk 4: Feature Overload (Medium Impact, Medium Probability)
**Risk:** Too many new features overwhelm users, reducing adoption.

**Mitigation:**
- Phased rollout (Phase 1 first, wait for feedback before Phase 2)
- Feature flags (enable for beta users, then gradual rollout)
- In-app tutorials ("New feature: Click here to try guided wizard")
- Opt-in for advanced features (ML insights, forecasting)

**Contingency:** Allow users to revert to "classic mode" without new features

---

#### Risk 5: Learning Curve for Advanced Analytics (Low Impact, Medium Probability)
**Risk:** Users don't understand R², p-values, or confidence intervals.

**Mitigation:**
- Contextual help tooltips ("R² of 0.87 means strong correlation")
- Visual color coding (green = good, red = weak)
- Plain English summaries ("This trend is statistically significant")
- Video tutorials and documentation

**Contingency:** Hide advanced statistics by default, show "Learn more" link

---

### Timeline Risks

#### Risk 6: Phase 4 Delays (Medium Impact, High Probability)
**Risk:** Forecasting models take longer than estimated (15 days → 25 days).

**Mitigation:**
- Use pre-built libraries (Prophet, statsmodels) rather than custom implementation
- Start with simpler models (ARIMA only, add LSTM later)
- Parallel development (while forecasting is in progress, work on dashboards)

**Contingency:** Move forecasting to Phase 5 (beyond 8 weeks) if necessary

---

#### Risk 7: Dependency on Missing Analysis Reports (High Impact, High Probability)
**Risk:** 3 of 5 analysis reports are missing (UX, Architecture, Code Quality), limiting recommendations.

**Mitigation:**
- **Immediate action:** Request UX, Architecture, and Code Quality reports
- Focus on recommendations that don't require missing data (ML enhancements, wizard)
- Update roadmap when additional reports become available

**Contingency:** This document will be **revised to version 2.0** when all 5 reports are available

---

### Dependency Risks

#### Risk 8: ACE IoT API Limitations (Low Impact, Low Probability)
**Risk:** API doesn't support streaming (required for P3-1), historical data access is limited.

**Mitigation:**
- Validate API capabilities before starting Phase 4
- Work with backend team to add streaming support
- Use polling as fallback (less efficient but functional)

**Contingency:** Defer real-time features (P3-1) until API supports streaming

### Appendix D: ML Model Selection Matrix

| Use Case | Model | Pros | Cons | Recommended |
|----------|-------|------|------|-------------|
| **Anomaly Detection** | Z-Score | Simple, fast, interpretable | Assumes normal distribution | ✅ Yes (Phase 1) |
| | Isolation Forest | No distribution assumptions | Slower, harder to explain | ❌ No (overkill) |
| | LSTM Autoencoder | Handles complex patterns | Requires training, heavy | ⏸️ Maybe (Phase 5+) |
| **Forecasting** | ARIMA | Industry standard, interpretable | Requires stationarity | ✅ Yes (Phase 4) |
| | Prophet | Handles seasonality, holidays | Heavier, less control | ✅ Yes (Phase 4) |
| | LSTM | Best for complex patterns | Requires lots of data, slow | ⏸️ Maybe (Phase 5+) |
| **Pattern Discovery** | K-Means | Fast, simple | Requires k selection | ✅ Yes (Phase 3) |
| | DBSCAN | Auto-detects cluster count | Sensitive to parameters | ❌ No (too complex) |
| | Hierarchical | Dendrogram visualization | Slow for large data | ⏸️ Maybe (Phase 5+) |
| **Regression** | Linear | Simple, fast, interpretable | Limited to linear relationships | ✅ Yes (Phase 2) |
| | Polynomial | Handles non-linear | Risk of overfitting | ✅ Yes (configurable) |
| | LOWESS | Smooth non-linear | Computationally expensive | ❌ No (overkill) |

**Recommendation:** Start with simple, interpretable models (Z-score, ARIMA, K-means, linear regression). Add complex models (LSTM, neural networks) only if business value justifies complexity.

- ML anomaly detection (proactive fault detection)

**Strategic Vision (Months 3-6):**
- Predictive analytics (forecasting, proactive maintenance)
- Multi-chart dashboards (holistic analysis)
- Real-time streaming (instant alerts)

**Expected ROI:**
- User satisfaction: +40%
- Chart creation time: -60%
- Energy waste detected: +$50K/building/year
- Support tickets: -70%

**Next Steps:**
1. ✅ Review and approve recommendations (This week)
2. ✅ Request missing analysis reports (Day 1)
3. ✅ Start Phase 1 development (Week 1)
4. ✅ Pilot testing with 2 buildings (Week 3+)

This master recommendations document will be **updated to v2.0** when all 5 analysis reports are available, providing a complete picture of UX issues, architecture consolidation opportunities, and code quality improvements.
