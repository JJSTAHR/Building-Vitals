# üìä DATA STATUS REPORT - Building Vitals

## üö® CRITICAL FINDINGS

### D1 Database Status
- **Database ID:** `1afc0a07-85cd-4d5f-a046-b580ffffb8dc` ‚úÖ (Correct)
- **Total Records:** **ONLY 36 RECORDS** ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Date Range:**
  - Earliest: October 16, 2025 5:20:35 PM
  - Latest: October 16, 2025 5:35:36 PM
  - **Only 15 minutes of data!**

### Table Schema Discovery
The `timeseries` table uses a different schema than expected:
```sql
- timestamp: INTEGER (Unix timestamp in milliseconds)
- point_id: INTEGER (references points table)
- value: REAL (the actual value)
- quality: INTEGER (default 192)
- flags: INTEGER (default 0)
```

**Important:** No `site_name` column - uses `point_id` instead!

### Why Charts Only Show Data from 10/15/2025 5:20 PM
**ANSWER:** Because that's literally ALL the data that exists in D1!
- The database only contains 36 data points
- All from October 16, 2025 between 5:20 PM and 5:35 PM
- This appears to be TEST DATA from today

## üìã WHAT THIS MEANS

1. **No Historical Data in D1** - The database is essentially empty
2. **No R2 Archive Data** - With only 36 records, nothing would be archived
3. **Backfill is CRITICAL** - You need to run the backfill to get historical data

## üîß IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED

### Step 1: Deploy ACE API Key to Backfill Worker
```bash
cd workers
wrangler secret put ACE_API_KEY --config wrangler-backfill.toml --env production
# Paste your ACE IoT API key when prompted
```

### Step 2: Start Historical Backfill
```bash
curl -X POST https://building-vitals-backfill.jstahr.workers.dev/trigger \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "site": "ses_falls_city",
    "start_date": "2024-01-01",
    "end_date": "2025-10-16",
    "reset": true
  }'
```

### Step 3: Monitor Progress
```powershell
# Use the monitoring script
.\scripts\monitor_backfill.ps1
```

### Step 4: Verify Data Population
```bash
# Check record count periodically
cd workers
wrangler d1 execute ace-iot-db --command="SELECT COUNT(*) FROM timeseries" --remote --config=wrangler-query.toml
```

## üìä Expected After Backfill

Once the backfill completes, you should have:
- **D1 Database:** Last 20 days of data (hot storage)
- **R2 Bucket:** Historical data older than 20 days (cold storage)
- **Total Data:** Full year from January 2024 to October 2025

## üéØ SUMMARY

**The Problem:** D1 only has 36 test records from today
**The Solution:** Run backfill to populate historical data
**Time to Fix:** ~24-48 hours for full backfill

The configuration is correct, the database exists and works, but it's essentially empty. The backfill process will populate it with all your historical data from the ACE IoT API.
